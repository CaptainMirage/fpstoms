# FPS TO MS

FPS TO MS is a cool little tool that lets you flip between Frames Per Second and Milliseconds in a snap. Whether you're a gamer, a filmmaker, or just curious, it's here to help you get a quick reference for frame timings.

## Features

- Easily switch between FPS and MS.
- Check out common frame rate examples for gaming and film.
- Built with modern tech like Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and PostCSS.

## Build Pipeline

This project rocks a build pipeline that uses:
- **Tailwind CSS** with JIT mode for speedy styling.
- **PostCSS** and Autoprefixer to keep things looking good in every browser.
- A **Makefile** (tweak it as needed) to automate your build tasks.

Just run your favorite build command (or customize the Makefile) to compile your assets and get rolling.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the build pipeline:
   * If you've set up your Makefile: `make`
   * Or use your own scripts for Tailwind/PostCSS if you prefer.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser and check out FPS TO MS in action!
